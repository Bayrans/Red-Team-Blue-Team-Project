# Red-Team-Blue-Team-Project
During my Sec+ Bootcamp we worked on a project where we emulated a Red Team Security Assessment and a Blue Team Log and Attack Analysis. 
I conducted A basic Pentest to gain unintended access, uploaded a reverse TCP payload, and established a meterpreter session following uploading and running a shell php script. 
Following this, I used Kibana to search through logs to analyze points of attack. 
The attached [PowerPoint](github.com/Bayrans/Red-Team-Blue-Team-Project/blob/main/LF%20Project%202.pdf) represents all the attacks performed, the vulnerabilities of the system, and mitigation strategies.
